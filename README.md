# DNA-Sequence-EDA-and-Multiclassifacation-
This project uses data containing DNA sequences from human belonging to different  classes of enzymes to build a highly accurate classifier for each of the classes
The multiclassifier was built using sklearn's MultinomialNB algorithm that is based on the Bayes theorem and the text to number conversion was done using a countvectorizer.
